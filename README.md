Description:
The PyPassword Generator is a Python script that generates a random password based on user input. It allows you to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers you want in your password. The program will then create a secure, random password using these criteria.

The password is generated with random characters selected from predefined lists of letters, symbols, and numbers.
The resulting password is shuffled to ensure a more randomized output.
